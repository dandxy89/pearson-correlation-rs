# Pearson Correlation SIMD

## Overview

Simple implementation of the Pearson Correlation algorithm in `Rust` using `SIMD` instructions.

It is intended solely as a project to familiarize myself with the use of SIMD instructions in `Rust` via the `packed_simd` crate.

## Tests

TODO - Will add tests in the week.
